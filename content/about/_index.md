<p class="lead">Welcome. My name is <strong>Carl Hoyer</strong>. I grew-up and currently live in the vast frontier of the Great White North, also known as Canada Eh!, nestled in the hills bordering suburban wilderness.</p>

I enjoy all forms of **technology**, from networking to application development; Great **design** is essential everywhere, and I hope my work helps to spread it; **Coding** is an exercise I've done since my early teens, and continue to do to varying extents today. I **unicycle**. I **climb**. I **create**.

My work in **design**, **development** and **system management** can be found under the company monikier [Pixolium](https://pixolium.ca).

You can peruse some of my code on [Github](https://github.com/choyer), such as this site, or enjoy short nuggets of wisdom via my Mastodon profile [@crh](https://hachyderm.io/@crh). Sometimes I even have flashes of [melodic genius](https://soundcloud.com/0derivative).

You can **support my further development efforts** if you find anything I've created useful via donation through: [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/crh) | [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/crh01)

When not in front of the keyboard, you can often find me on the trails **mountain unicycling** or on the roads **distance unicycling**. I met my wife through the sport of unicycling and it continues to offer new learning oportunities and amazing adventures. **Everyone can ride a unicycle!** I maintain a site of some of the **best mountain unicycle quotes** on [mountainunicycling.com](https://mountainunicycling.com).
