This site is statically generated by **[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)** and served by [Cliff L. Biffle's](https://cliffle.com) lightweight [httpd2](https://github.com/cbiffle/httpd2/) static file server. The site is currently hosted through [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/3403fb75e2a0), however I have plans to host it myself on a solar powered embedded linux server in the very near future (mid-2024).

### Privacy
Privacy is important to me and therefore this site respects your privacy as well. It does so by adhering to the following principles:

* **ALL content is hosted locally!** *(html, js, css, images, webfonts, etc.)*. **NO** CDN's are used for delivering any of this site, it's straight from the firehose. 
* **You will be given the choice to load any embedded external content** *(e.g. Youtube, etc.)*. It will load only after you provide explicit consent.
* **NO cookies are set by this site**, and this website **DOES NOT** track you across any other sites.
* **IP address** and **user-agent** *(if provided)* are used only for network issue diagnostics and/or site security and are only kept temporarily.

### Design
The design of this site is based on my own customized [Hyde derivative](https://github.com/choyer/hyde), which originated from the [Zola port of Hyde](https://github.com/getzola/hyde), which in turn was inspired by the original [Hyde Theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) for Jekyll by [Mark Otto](https://markdotto.com/).

CSS is managed using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). Social icons provided by [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)
